  This year I learned a bunch of vocab words about problem solving, html, css and javascript, I learned a lot of html/JS. I learned how to create elements that show up on screen with javascript and no html. I learned how to build websites using HTML, CSS and javascript, I used CSS to make the pages look better and Javascript to let the user interact with the page.
