    <h2>CSS Specificity</h2>
    <p>If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity will "win", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.</p>
    <p>You can just think of it as a hierarchy that determines which style declaration is ultimately applied to an element. </p>
